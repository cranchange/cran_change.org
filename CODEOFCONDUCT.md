Authors of the cranchange petition are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone interested in contributing to or discussing this initiative.

We accept that there is great diversity in the experiences people have had dealing with CRAN, and that people's views on reform my fall anywhere on the spectrum from minimal to radical.

With this movement we are trying to create space for a conversation where people are comfortable exploring ideas, asking questions, and saying things like “I don’t understand” or “Why”. Assume competence in the people you interact with. There are no stupid questions.

Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow community members.

Take care of each other. Alert any of the @cranchange/authors if you notice a someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. This includes speech directed at or referring to CRAN adminstators. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

    offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices
    unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
    sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
    deliberate intimidation
    continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
    unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
    pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
    inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
    stalking or following
    threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
    use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
    unwelcome sexual attention
    deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
    deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
    publication of non-harassing private communication

We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

    ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
    reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
    communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
    criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, they will experince action. It may include a warning, or requestt them to leave discussions temporarily, or being permanently blocked.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the CRAN change movement including Slack channels, GitHub project repositories, video calls.
