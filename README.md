# cran_change.org

This is a petition calling for CRAN reform.


* [Draft 1](https://github.com/cranchange/cran_change.org/tree/e0352a4be5f8e211d1bd4cc6cbb25e36aa3e3f2b) was put out for community feedback using a [Google form](https://forms.gle/iS5UFnv3yTtW6Dzg9) that received 13 responses. It also attracted feedback in an [issue thread](https://github.com/cranchange/cran_change.org/issues/19)
  - No issues were raised with the proposed reforms
  - Feedback on the tone was close to evenly divided, slightly in favour of support.
  - The most common problems expressed were that the letter should be more constructive, the opening line was inflammatory, as were items in the 'Supporting this petition' section. 
* Draft 2 (current) is still being revised, but community feedback is welcome. Please feel free to file an issue.
  - This draft tries to more specifically describe the problems and frame the proposals more constructively. It tries to balance a firm tone with being constructive, and appropriately appreciative of CRAN's efforts.
  - The 'Supporting this petition' items have been removed since on reflection they seemed to preempt CRAN's response.
  - Many new ideas in the draft come from a [PR made by Llu√≠s Revilla](https://github.com/cranchange/cran_change.org/pull/21).
